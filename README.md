# Language_template
LaTeX template for submitting an article to Language. Not an official one, just some settings I figured out. Follows this style sheet: https://www.linguisticsociety.org/sites/default/files/LANGUAGE_journal_style_sheet.pdf. 
There are probably much better ways to do this and I don't claim to be a LaTeX expert.
But, this will hopefully be a useful starting point and save some time. I wasn't able to get every tiny detail of the reference formatting exactly the same as the style sheet. But it is very nearly there.
